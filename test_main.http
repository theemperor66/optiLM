{
  "message": "I need to solve a multi-objective non-linear integer programming problem with 15 variables and 20 constraints. The first objective is to maximize revenue which is calculated as the sum of the product of price and quantity for each product. The second objective is to minimize cost which includes fixed costs and variable costs. The constraints include capacity constraints, demand constraints, and budget constraints. Can you help me formulate and solve this problem?"
